# 🚀 **Next.js Web App – Deepfake Detection System**

This is a **Next.js** project built with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), serving as the **frontend for a real-time deepfake detection system**. The app provides an intuitive user interface for uploading videos and receiving analysis results powered by state-of-the-art AI and machine learning models.

## ⚙️ **Getting Started**

To run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

You can begin development by editing the `app/page.tsx` file. Changes will automatically reflect in the browser.

## 🧠 **Deepfake Detection Model**

This project is designed to detect manipulated content in video files, focusing specifically on **deepfake videos** (videos where a person’s face is digitally altered).

### **Model Overview:**
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: The backend model leverages cutting-edge AI frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV** to process and analyze video frames.
- **Datasets**: The model is trained using large-scale datasets, including:
  - **DFDC (DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset)**: A dataset with thousands of deepfake videos for model training.
  - **Celeb-DF**: A high-quality deepfake dataset focused on celebrity faces, ideal for high-resolution deepfake analysis.
  - **World Leaders Dataset**: A collection of deepfake videos featuring world leaders, helping the model generalize across different facial structures and lighting conditions.
  
### **Real-Time Detection**:
- The system is being optimized for **live deepfake face detection**, where users can upload videos and receive **instant feedback** on whether the video is real or manipulated.

## 🛠 **Available Services**

- **Deepfake Video Upload**: Users can upload videos of any format (mp4, mov, avi) to be analyzed by the AI.
- **Deepfake Analysis**: Once the video is uploaded, the AI model processes the frames, identifies manipulated faces, and returns an analysis report detailing whether the video is **real** or **fake**.
- **Results Visualization**: A comprehensive results page that highlights areas in the video where deepfake manipulation is detected, alongside confidence scores and suggestions for further analysis.

## 🏗 **Work Done So Far**

- **Frontend Development**:  
   - **UI/UX Design**: Designed and developed an interactive and user-friendly interface using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
   - **Video Upload Feature**: Built a smooth video upload and submission flow that supports various formats and file sizes.  
   - **Results Display**: Developed components to display analysis results in a clean and intuitive manner.

- **Backend & AI Model Development** (in progress):  
   - **Model Integration**: Currently working on integrating a robust **deepfake detection model** that will process uploaded videos and analyze them for facial manipulations.  
   - **Real-time Analysis**: The goal is to enable **real-time deepfake detection** for video content, leveraging advanced AI techniques for face recognition and anomaly detection.  
   - **Ongoing Model Training**: The model is being trained on large datasets such as **DFDC**, **Celeb-DF**, and **World Leaders Dataset** to improve detection accuracy and reliability.
